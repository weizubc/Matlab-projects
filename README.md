# Matlab-projects
This is a computationsl experiment project. I used Matlab to implement three learning algorithms in artificial agent-based simulations of the Kiyotaki-Wright model. The objective of this experiment is to encourage greater speculative behavior by certain player types.  
1. Learning by imitation. 
2. Learning by experience. 
3. Learning by eliminating noise. 

Simulation results suggest that all of the three algorithms serve to increase the speed with which players learn to adopt speculative strategies, and that the first treatment has the relatively greater impact on the speed of learning.
