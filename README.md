# Matlab-projects
This is a computational experiment project. I used Matlab to implement three learning algorithms in artificial agent-based simulations of the Kiyotaki-Wright model. The objective of this experiment is to encourage greater speculative behavior by certain player types.  
* Learning by imitation. 
* Learning by experience. 
* Learning by eliminating noise.
